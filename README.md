# Supervised-Learning-Classification
Predicting heart disease using machine learning - proof-of-concept ML project. Checked several models using `RandomizedSearchCV` and `GridSearchCV`.

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model.

Classifier will be able to predict whether or not patient has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

Data used for modelling is UCI Heart Disease dataset:
